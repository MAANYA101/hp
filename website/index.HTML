<p id="xmp"> Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a 2002 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus 
    from a screenplay by Steve Kloves, based on the 1998 novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling.
     Produced by David Heyman, it is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and 
     the second instalment in the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as 
     Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The story follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a monster that petrifies the school's students.

The film was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 November 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Critics praised its darker plot, sets and a story appropriate for a young audience, and it became a critical and commercial success, grossing $879 million worldwide and becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2002. The film was nominated for many awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. It was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)

<p>Spending the summer with the Dursleys, Harry Potter meets Dobby, a house-elf who warns him that it is
 dangerous to return to Hogwarts. Dobby sabotages an important dinner for the Dursleys, who lock up
      Harry to prevent his return to Hogwarts. Harry's friend Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George rescue him in their father's flying car.
In Diagon Alley, Harry, the Weasleys and Hermione Granger notice a book-signing by Gilderoy Lockhart,
 Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. There, Harry sees Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius, 
 slip a book into Ginny Weasley's cauldron. After being blocked from entering Platform Nine and 
 Three-Quarters at King's Cross railway station, Harry and Ron take the car to Hogwarts. There, they 
 crash into the Whomping Willow, breaking Ron's wand, and receive detention.
